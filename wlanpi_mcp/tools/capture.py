"""
Wi-Fi packet-capture tools backed by the wlanpi-core capture WebSocket.

wlanpi-core exposes capture only over `/api/v1/streaming/capture`, so these
tools open that socket, authenticate with the same wlanpi-core JWT used for
every REST call, run a bounded capture, and return a dissected summary. A
capture lives with its socket: the owner flow always stops the capture and
closes the socket before returning, so no ownerless capture is left running.

        Run a live Wi-Fi packet capture and return what was on the air.

        This captures real 802.11 frames off the air (unlike scan_wlan, which
        asks the driver for a scan), so it reports what is actually being
        transmitted. The call blocks for duration_s seconds and returns a
        dissected summary — never raw pcap.

        The result has two parts:
        - 'aps': one row per BSSID from beacons/probe-responses, with SSID,
          channel, signal, 802.11 amendments, advertised TX power, full
          security detail — the compact 'security' label plus 'akm' (the AKM
          suite list), 'pairwise_ciphers', 'group_cipher' and 'pmf' — and,
          when the AP advertises a QBSS/BSS Load element, 'stations' (the
          associated client count) and 'channel_utilization' (percent).
        - 'frames' / 'frame_types': every frame's named type/subtype counted
          exactly in 'frame_types', plus up to max_frames per-frame records in
          'frames'. Each record has the source/destination addresses
          (addr1..addr4), a full radiotap decode, and — for the frames that
          carry one — a decoded 'result': authentication algorithm+status,
          association status+AID, deauth/disassoc reason, or probe/assoc SSID.

        The capture is owned by this call and is stopped before it returns.
        If another application is already capturing on the interface, this
        tool subscribes to that capture read-only instead of failing; the
        result always says whether the role was 'owner' or 'subscriber' and
        reports the running config.

        Single-radio caveat: where the capture interface shares a radio with
        the managed wlan0, channel changes fail while wlan0 scans. Any such
        failures come back in 'channel_issues' — treat those results as
        partial rather than complete.

        Args:
            interface: Monitor-mode capture interface, always named 'wlanpiN'
                (e.g. 'wlanpi0'), not 'wlan0'. Use get_network_interfaces or
                get_capture_channels to see what exists on this device.
            channels: Channel numbers to hop (e.g. [1, 6, 11, 36]); 6 GHz can
                be given as explicit frequencies in MHz. Omit to hop every
                channel the adapter supports.
            width: Channel width in MHz: 20, 40, 80 or 160.
            dwell_ms: Milliseconds to dwell on each channel (50–60000).
            duration_s: How long to capture, 1–60 seconds. The tool call
                blocks for this whole window.
            pcap_filter: Optional BPF/pcap filter, e.g. 'type mgt subtype beacon'.
            max_frames: Cap on per-frame records returned in 'frames';
                per-kind counts in 'frame_types' are always exact. Set 0 to
                skip the per-frame records and get only the AP table and
                counts, or a negative value for no cap (every frame — a busy
                capture can then return tens of thousands of records, so use
                the file-capture tools for a full pcap instead). Beacons
                dominate a busy capture, so a pcap_filter such as 'not type mgt
                subtype beacon' makes the record list focus on the
